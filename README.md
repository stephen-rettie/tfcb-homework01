# Homework 1

This homework has asked us to:

1. Populate our GitHub bios

1. Create a local repository and fill it with the provided data

1. Push that local repository to GitHub

1. Restructure and rename the data to provide structure to the project and consistency to the file naming

1. Write a `README.md` like this one showcasing heads, lists, [links](https://xkcd.com/1296/), images and tables

Here is an image that I can't think of a smooth way to segue to in this README:

Here is a table detailing what I was supposed to do and if I think I did it:

|Task| Did I accomplish it|
|-|-|
|Use a header | I think so|
|Make a list | I think so|
|Use a link | I think so |
|Link to an image in the repository | I think so |
|Demonstrate a table | I think so |
